# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Update binary integrity** — `downloadAsset()` now verifies the SHA-256 digest from the GitHub Releases API `digest` field before handing the file to the OS installer; a mismatch deletes the downloaded file and aborts the update. The HTTPS scheme check was tightened to use `Uri.tryParse` rather than a string prefix, so a malformed URL is caught as an `UpdateException` rather than a raw `FormatException`.

---

## [0.1.20] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Sudo SFTP (root file transfers)** — each host now has an **SFTP Mode** setting (Default / Sudo (root) / Custom command). In Sudo mode, yourssh starts the remote `sftp-server` through `sudo` over an exec channel (WinSCP-style) instead of the standard SFTP subsystem, so the entire SFTP session — browse, upload, download, rename, delete — runs as root. No more uploading to a temp dir and `sudo cp`-ing into place. It auto-detects the `sftp-server` path across distros (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora, Arch/SUSE), works with `NOPASSWD` sudoers entries, and otherwise prompts for the sudo password (validated separately via `sudo -S -v`, optionally remembered in the system keychain). Custom mode runs any server command verbatim (e.g. `sudo -u deploy …`). Failures surface a clear, actionable error (including a ready-to-paste `NOPASSWD` sudoers line) rather than silently falling back to a non-elevated session. A **root** badge marks elevated SFTP panels; terminal path autocomplete never triggers a sudo prompt.
- **Open with external app (SFTP)** — files the in-app editor cannot handle (binary formats, files over 5 MB) now offer to open with your OS default application instead; any file can also be opened externally from the SFTP context menu. While the file is open, yourssh watches the local copy and automatically uploads it back to the server every time the external app saves (WinSCP-style external editing).

### Fixed
- **SFTP file editing on Linux/Windows** — double-clicking a file in the SFTP panel no longer blanks the entire window on platforms where the embedded webview (Monaco) is unavailable. The editor now falls back to a plain-text editor with save support (`Ctrl+S`). ([#34](https://github.com/YoursshLabs/yourssh/issues/34))

---

## [0.1.19] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **In-app updates (assisted download)** — yourssh now checks GitHub Releases for a newer stable version on launch (debounced to once per 24h) and on demand via a **Settings → Updates** button. When an update is available, a dismissible banner appears at the top of the app; choosing **Update** downloads the correct artifact for your OS/architecture and hands it to the OS installer (macOS strips the `com.apple.quarantine` flag and opens the DMG; Windows runs the installer `.exe`; Linux opens the `.deb`/`.tar.gz` with the desktop handler). If no artifact matches your platform (e.g. an Intel Mac) or a download/launch fails, it falls back to opening the Releases page in your browser. Because the app is not code-signed, this is an assisted flow — it never silently replaces itself.

---

## [0.1.18] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Shell integration (OSC 7 / OSC 133)** — yourssh now injects a small, guarded prompt-hook into bash/zsh sessions on connect (auto-on, opt-out per host and globally in **Settings → Terminal**) so it can read the remote shell's working directory and command boundaries via semantic-prompt escape sequences. This powers: the **working directory shown on the session tab** (e.g. `web-prod · app`), a **per-command status gutter** down the left of the terminal (green dot = exit 0, red = non-zero, grey = running), **jump-to-prompt** navigation (`Cmd/Ctrl+↑/↓` scrolls between command prompts), and **cwd-aware path autocomplete** in the command input bar (lists the resolved remote directory over SFTP). Sequences are captured via xterm's `onPrivateOSC` (no raw-stream parsing); non-bash/zsh shells and sessions where the markers are stripped simply see the feature stay inactive. The injected hooks affect only the live shell session — they never modify `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Connection health badge** — a live, latency-driven dot on each session tab: green (`<150ms`), amber (`150–500ms`), red (`>500ms` or unreachable), grey (connecting / no reading), with a pulsing amber dot during (re)connect. Hovering shows uptime, last-ping age, and the per-session reconnect count. A new `HealthMonitorService` pings each connected host over the live SSH channel (`SSHClient.ping`) on the keep-alive interval and becomes the sole pinger (the client's built-in keepalive is disabled), so a 5s ping timeout also surfaces half-open silent drops that the channel-close reconnect path cannot detect.

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Cloud sync secret is now a 12-character sync code** — synced data is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) with a key derived from a random 12-char Crockford-Base32 code that is also the Supabase row id, replacing the anon-key-derived encryption and optional passphrase. The anon key is now only an API credential and can no longer decrypt anything. Generate a code on one device in **Settings → Sync** and enter it on your other devices to join — it is the only key to your data. Existing `default`-keyed rows are not migrated (fresh start); the old passphrase secret is removed on upgrade.

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Cloud sync rejected by Supabase `sync_data` policy** — the shipped client keys its row by the fixed id `default` (7 chars), but older deployments created `sync_data` with a `char_length(sync_id) = 12` CHECK (and a matching RLS `with check`) left over from an abandoned "sync code" design. Those constraints rejected every write (column CHECK → `23514`, RLS with-check → `42501`). The migration now drops the legacy constraint and relaxes the RLS policy to `with check (true)`; confidentiality still comes from client-side AES-GCM encryption of the payload. No-op on fresh installs.

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Advanced tab management** — rename tabs (double-click or right-click → Rename), color tags (8 preset colors shown as a dot), pin tabs (moves to front, hides close button, persists across reconnects), drag reorder (horizontal drag with pinned/unpinned zone boundary). All metadata persists per host via SharedPreferences (`TabMetadataService`).

### Fixed
- **Code editor: crash when opening an unreadable remote file** — opening a directory, a virtual/special file, or a file that hits a permission/IO error in the Monaco editor threw an unhandled `SftpStatusError` (SSH_FX_FAILURE, code 4) from the SFTP read and crashed the editor. `_loadFile` now catches the failure, shows the error in a SnackBar, and closes the editor instead of hanging on the loading spinner.

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Terminal sharing (multiplayer)** — host shares a live SSH session via a session code; guests join through the Command Palette ("Join Shared Session") or the `JoinShareDialog` and watch (or interact with) the terminal in real time. Built on Supabase Realtime channels; the host controls who can type via `targetGuestId`. A watch banner is shown in split-terminal view for guest sessions. Backed by `ShareSessionService`, `ShareProvider`, `ShareEvent`, and `ShareSessionDialog` / `JoinShareDialog`

### Fixed
- **Linux: missing `libkeybinder-3.0` at launch** — Ubuntu users without `libkeybinder-3.0-0` installed would get a shared-library crash on start. `libkeybinder-3.0.so.0` is now copied into the app bundle's `lib/` directory during cmake install, so no system package is required

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Docker / Kubernetes container browser** in the DevOps hub — lists running containers (`docker ps`) and pods (`kubectl get pods`) over an active SSH session, with a namespace field and an all-namespaces toggle for Kubernetes. An **Exec** action opens a new terminal tab that drops straight into the container/pod (`docker exec -it` / `kubectl exec -it`, with a bash→sh fallback; multi-container pods prompt for a container). When `docker`/`kubectl` is missing or unauthorized, an install/permission hint with a copy button is shown instead. Backed by a new `ContainerService` and an `initialCommand` threaded onto `SshSession` so the new shell runs the exec command on open

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Snippets plugin restored** — `SnippetProvider` is registered again (its absence was crashing the app), and the Plugin Manager now lists both built-in plugins (with enable/disable toggles) and loaded JS script plugins instead of showing only help text

### Fixed
- **Recordings screen crash on open** — opening the Recordings library threw `Cannot hit test a render box with no size` and the mouse-tracker `!_debugDuringDeviceUpdate` assertion. A `SizedBox(width: double.infinity)` used as a direct `Row` child resolved to an infinite width, leaving the row with no size; the library now renders the list directly when no recording is playing and only splits into a fixed-width list + player when one is

### Changed
- Moved the terminal **REC** (start/stop recording) button from the top-left to the top-right corner so it is easier to see

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Smart host filter** — the dashboard search box now parses a faceted query (`env:prod role:db region:sg`): values under the same tag key OR together, different keys AND together, and free-text terms match host label / address / username / tag values. Tags (`key:value`) are finally searchable. A row of toggleable suggestion chips above the host list builds the query with a tap

### Changed
- Internal refactor across `app/lib` (no behavior change): deduplicated helpers in `KeyProvider`, `KnownHostsProvider`, `AiChatProvider`, and `SftpTransferService`; replaced the 60-case hotkey `switch` with an O(1) `Map` lookup; precomputed search query and pinned-groups `Set` in the hosts dashboard to avoid per-frame work; guarded a redundant `notifyListeners()` in `LocalFilePanelProvider`
- Split large widgets for readability: extracted `_LocalEntryRow` from `LocalFilePanel`'s list builder, and split the sync settings section into `_buildCloudTab` / `_buildP2pTab` with a shared field-decoration helper

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Release pipeline expanded to build for all supported architectures: macOS arm64, x86_64, and universal binary; Windows x64 and arm64; Linux x86_64 and arm64

---

- **ScriptPluginPanelScreen** — WebView renderer for plugin panels with bidirectional JS↔Dart bridge
- **PluginLoader** — disk scan + DirectoryWatcher for hot-reload; permission consent dialog on first install
- **BundledPluginInstaller** — ships bundled plugins in app assets, installs to `~/.yourssh/plugins/` on first run
- **Snippets plugin migrated to JS** — compiled `yourssh_snippets` replaced by `dev.yourssh.snippets` JS plugin bundled in assets; data migrated from old SharedPreferences key automatically
- **Plugin Console** — per-plugin log viewer (Settings → Script Plugins) showing `console.log` output and errors
- **Plugin Manager screen** — shows pending consent, plugin directory info
- **Plugin Authoring Guide** (`docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md`) — A-Z guide for writing plugins: manifest, hook API, bridge API, native panel messages, examples, debugging, known limitations

### Changed
- `SshService` now accepts optional `HookBus` for terminal data interception
- `SshService.exec()` fires `command.before` (interceptable) and `command.after` (observe) hooks
- `SshService.connect()` fires `session.connect.before` (interceptable) hook
- `SshBridgeDelegate` extended with `sendInput(sessionId, text)` for terminal injection

### Removed
- `yourssh_snippets` compiled Dart plugin (replaced by bundled JS plugin)
