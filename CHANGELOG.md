## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.1.17] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Connection health badge** — a live, latency-driven dot on each session tab: green (`<150ms`), amber (`150–500ms`), red (`>500ms` or unreachable), grey (connecting / no reading), with a pulsing amber dot during (re)connect. Hovering shows uptime, last-ping age, and the per-session reconnect count. A new `HealthMonitorService` pings each connected host over the live SSH channel (`SSHClient.ping`) on the keep-alive interval and becomes the sole pinger (the client's built-in keepalive is disabled), so a 5s ping timeout also surfaces half-open silent drops that the channel-close reconnect path cannot detect.

---

## [0.1.16] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Cloud sync secret is now a 12-character sync code** — synced data is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) with a key derived from a random 12-char Crockford-Base32 code that is also the Supabase row id, replacing the anon-key-derived encryption and optional passphrase. The anon key is now only an API credential and can no longer decrypt anything. Generate a code on one device in **Settings → Sync** and enter it on your other devices to join — it is the only key to your data. Existing `default`-keyed rows are not migrated (fresh start); the old passphrase secret is removed on upgrade.

---

## [0.1.15] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Cloud sync rejected by Supabase `sync_data` policy** — the shipped client keys its row by the fixed id `default` (7 chars), but older deployments created `sync_data` with a `char_length(sync_id) = 12` CHECK (and a matching RLS `with check`) left over from an abandoned "sync code" design. Those constraints rejected every write (column CHECK → `23514`, RLS with-check → `42501`). The migration now drops the legacy constraint and relaxes the RLS policy to `with check (true)`; confidentiality still comes from client-side AES-GCM encryption of the payload. No-op on fresh installs.

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Advanced tab management** — rename tabs (double-click or right-click → Rename), color tags (8 preset colors shown as a dot), pin tabs (moves to front, hides close button, persists across reconnects), drag reorder (horizontal drag with pinned/unpinned zone boundary). All metadata persists per host via SharedPreferences (`TabMetadataService`).

### Fixed
- **Code editor: crash when opening an unreadable remote file** — opening a directory, a virtual/special file, or a file that hits a permission/IO error in the Monaco editor threw an unhandled `SftpStatusError` (SSH_FX_FAILURE, code 4) from the SFTP read and crashed the editor. `_loadFile` now catches the failure, shows the error in a SnackBar, and closes the editor instead of hanging on the loading spinner.

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Terminal sharing (multiplayer)** — host shares a live SSH session via a session code; guests join through the Command Palette ("Join Shared Session") or the `JoinShareDialog` and watch (or interact with) the terminal in real time. Built on Supabase Realtime channels; the host controls who can type via `targetGuestId`. A watch banner is shown in split-terminal view for guest sessions. Backed by `ShareSessionService`, `ShareProvider`, `ShareEvent`, and `ShareSessionDialog` / `JoinShareDialog`

### Fixed
- **Linux: missing `libkeybinder-3.0` at launch** — Ubuntu users without `libkeybinder-3.0-0` installed would get a shared-library crash on start. `libkeybinder-3.0.so.0` is now copied into the app bundle's `lib/` directory during cmake install, so no system package is required

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Docker / Kubernetes container browser** in the DevOps hub — lists running containers (`docker ps`) and pods (`kubectl get pods`) over an active SSH session, with a namespace field and an all-namespaces toggle for Kubernetes. An **Exec** action opens a new terminal tab that drops straight into the container/pod (`docker exec -it` / `kubectl exec -it`, with a bash→sh fallback; multi-container pods prompt for a container). When `docker`/`kubectl` is missing or unauthorized, an install/permission hint with a copy button is shown instead. Backed by a new `ContainerService` and an `initialCommand` threaded onto `SshSession` so the new shell runs the exec command on open

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Snippets plugin restored** — `SnippetProvider` is registered again (its absence was crashing the app), and the Plugin Manager now lists both built-in plugins (with enable/disable toggles) and loaded JS script plugins instead of showing only help text

### Fixed
- **Recordings screen crash on open** — opening the Recordings library threw `Cannot hit test a render box with no size` and the mouse-tracker `!_debugDuringDeviceUpdate` assertion. A `SizedBox(width: double.infinity)` used as a direct `Row` child resolved to an infinite width, leaving the row with no size; the library now renders the list directly when no recording is playing and only splits into a fixed-width list + player when one is

### Changed
- Moved the terminal **REC** (start/stop recording) button from the top-left to the top-right corner so it is easier to see

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Smart host filter** — the dashboard search box now parses a faceted query (`env:prod role:db region:sg`): values under the same tag key OR together, different keys AND together, and free-text terms match host label / address / username / tag values. Tags (`key:value`) are finally searchable. A row of toggleable suggestion chips above the host list builds the query with a tap

### Changed
- Internal refactor across `app/lib` (no behavior change): deduplicated helpers in `KeyProvider`, `KnownHostsProvider`, `AiChatProvider`, and `SftpTransferService`; replaced the 60-case hotkey `switch` with an O(1) `Map` lookup; precomputed search query and pinned-groups `Set` in the hosts dashboard to avoid per-frame work; guarded a redundant `notifyListeners()` in `LocalFilePanelProvider`
- Split large widgets for readability: extracted `_LocalEntryRow` from `LocalFilePanel`'s list builder, and split the sync settings section into `_buildCloudTab` / `_buildP2pTab` with a shared field-decoration helper

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Release pipeline expanded to build for all supported architectures: macOS arm64, x86_64, and universal binary; Windows x64 and arm64; Linux x86_64 and arm64

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-31

- **Native panel messages** from plugin WebView HTML: `ssh-exec`, `ssh-sessions`, `sftp-list`, `sftp-read` — handled async in Dart, enables SSH/SFTP from panel HTML without JS async limitations
- **ScriptPluginPanelScreen** — WebView renderer for plugin panels with bidirectional JS↔Dart bridge
- **PluginLoader** — disk scan + DirectoryWatcher for hot-reload; permission consent dialog on first install
- **BundledPluginInstaller** — ships bundled plugins in app assets, installs to `~/.yourssh/plugins/` on first run
- **Snippets plugin migrated to JS** — compiled `yourssh_snippets` replaced by `dev.yourssh.snippets` JS plugin bundled in assets; data migrated from old SharedPreferences key automatically
- **Plugin Console** — per-plugin log viewer (Settings → Script Plugins) showing `console.log` output and errors
- **Plugin Manager screen** — shows pending consent, plugin directory info
- **Plugin Authoring Guide** (`docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md`) — A-Z guide for writing plugins: manifest, hook API, bridge API, native panel messages, examples, debugging, known limitations

### Changed
- `SshService` now accepts optional `HookBus` for terminal data interception
- `SshService.exec()` fires `command.before` (interceptable) and `command.after` (observe) hooks
- `SshService.connect()` fires `session.connect.before` (interceptable) hook
- `SshBridgeDelegate` extended with `sendInput(sessionId, text)` for terminal injection

### Removed
- `yourssh_snippets` compiled Dart plugin (replaced by bundled JS plugin)
